## Project Overview

Ensemble learning is a powerful machine learning paradigm that improves model accuracy by combining the predictions from multiple models. This project covers:

- Introduction to Ensemble Learning
- Key techniques such as Bagging, Boosting, and Stacking
- Code examples demonstrating the application of ensemble methods in practice

### Main Topics Covered

1. **Bagging**: A technique that reduces variance by training multiple instances of a model on different subsets of the dataset.
   - Example: Random Forest, which is an ensemble of decision trees.
   
2. **Boosting**: A sequential technique where each model tries to correct the errors of the previous one.
   - Example: Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), XGBoost.

3. **Stacking**: Combines multiple different models, typically using a meta-model that learns how to best combine the individual predictions.
   - Example: Blending predictions from Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM.

### Requirements

To run the code examples in this project, you need the following libraries:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- `scikit-learn`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`

You can install the required Python packages by running:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn numpy pandas matplotlib
```

### Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ensemble-learning-exploration.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd ensemble-learning-exploration
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter notebook to explore the code:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

### Usage

The project contains a detailed explanation of various ensemble learning methods with code snippets for each method. To experiment with the code:

1. Open the `ensemble_learning.ipynb` notebook file.
2. Run the code cells to see the outputs and try modifying the parameters to observe how the ensemble models' performance changes.
